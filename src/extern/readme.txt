because of licensing issues, we can't distribute the vst sdk, so you have to
download it yourself, and copy the following files into this directory:
  aeffect.h
  aeffectx.h
  vstfxstore.h
the vst sdk kan be downloaded from here:
  http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html
  ("VST 3.6.5 Audio Plug-Ins SDK")
and the required files are found in the
  VST3 SDK/pluginterfaces/vst2.x/
directory inside the zip file
