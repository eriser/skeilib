not decided yet..

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* vst: not compatible with opensource licenses that require redistribution of
       all required files..
* gpl: need to be gpl ourselves
* gpl: can't release closed source

----------

"GPL requires to include all of the required source code which implies to
include ('re-distribute') the VST-SDK which the VST license not allows"

"As the first author of the software, you can actually just release your
source, and have the users get the SDK them selves. As the first authour, you
can do what ever you want. The problem is that this basically makes the GPL
pointless since the recipients can't redistribute the software in turn. It also
means you can't rely on any gpl'ed libs and such. So essentially, you are only
pushing the problem on to your users."

"Steinberg has terms in their VST SDK license that forbids anyone to
redistribute it. In order to build this project, you need some header files
from the SDK. Under the terms of the GPL, if you distribute a binary built from
GPL'ed code then you must distribute the source. This would involve
redistributing the SDK which would violate the terms of Steinberg's license."

so, maybe..
triple license?

a) free, opensource

  gpl
  
b) free, closed source

  require updated and equal binaries for all platforms
  or contribution back to lib/project..

c) commercial

----------------------------------------------------------------------

do we need/want additional clause for vst, or whatever?
"you are allowed to..."

argh..
