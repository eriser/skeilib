[ preliminary, temporary, work in progress ]

not 100% decided..
for the current version (v0.0.0) assume gpl3..
(we will fix this when/if it becomes an issue)





----------------------------------------------------------------------
triple license.. choose one
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. opensource

   * gpl3
   
2. closed source, free

   * treat all platforms equal
     no windows-only plugins, please.. neither any "works best in linux",
     or "that feature is only available on mac versions"..
   * make the plugins easily available
     not for just a limited time.. consider 'bitrot', 10 years ahead..
     let other people distribute your plugins..
   * no gpl
     you can't use any of the gpl parts of the library
   * promotion
     plugins need to have the "powered by skeilib" logo somewhere on the gui
     (could be hidden away in an 'about' window or similar),
     and/or in the documentation, readme-files, etc..
     to make it very obvious that your plugins are based on skeilib

3. closed source, commercial

   * discouraged
   * costs $$$ (contact us)
   * code creator licenses
     give author(s) of the code you use licenses to your plugin, and/or free
     versions (including updates, just as if they had bought your plugin)
   * you can't use any of the gpl parts of the library
   
   commercial doesn't just mean sold for money.. if you want anything in
   return for your plugin, no matter what it is, money, facebook likes, an
   email, twitter retweets, website registration, or whatever,
   it's considered commercial..

----------------------------------------------------------------------

general guidelines:
(what we hope to achieve with the licensing mess)

* we want to promote linux as a good music production platform, so linux
  versions of plugins is very important for us..
  (if you can't compile linux versions, we can help you with that..)

* you shouldn't run off with other people's work, to earn money, fame,
  reputation, etc, without giving something back:
  
  - gpl: you contribute the possibility for us to take your code, and bring
    some of it back into skeilib, and thus improving it..
  - closed/free: you help us with promoting the library
  - closed/commercial: you need to compensate the us in other ways
  
  and always remember: credit where credit's due..
  
* don't try to be sneaky and find loopholes or whatever..
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

notes to self:

* add a "-gpl" or similar switch to the compile scripts, and put all gpl
  related code in specific /gpl directories, so that people have to actively
  choose to use it.. we don't want any "sorry, i didn't know!" excuses :-)
